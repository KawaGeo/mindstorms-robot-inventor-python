This is my first working repository. My goal is to convert Word Blocks to Python code as close as possible for all basic models. Some projects must be excluded due to a lack of remote control and other issues.

There are about 40 projects available for most models except the VIP model which requires remote control. Most of them are working in progress. Once completed, they will be uploaded to my repository model by model. Charlie model will be the first one.

You may find a file in Python code for the Blast model in the basic version somewhere in the repository as an example.
